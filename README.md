## Description
2 MATLAB scripts can be seen:

  1. tfgModel.m contains the script for training a artificial neural network. It can only be run with access to the dataset.
  2. predict.m contains the script for predicting classes on a specified dataset. It requires having the saved network in your MATLAB workspace/the script folder.

Additionally you can find the report and annexes inside of the doc folder.

## Dataset
As the dataset used is not open source, access request to it and more information can be found here (the dataset is only available in .mat format to the public): [TristánC. A. 2021. Neural network Database. ](http://hdl.handle.net/10259/5896)
