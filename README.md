## Description
2 MATLAB scripts can be seen:

  1. tfgModel.m contains the script for training a artificial neural network. It can only be run with access to the dataset.
  2. predict.m contains the script for predicting classes on a specified dataset. It requires having the saved network in your MATLAB workspace/the script folder.

Additionally you can find the report and annexes inside of the doc folder.

## Dataset
As the dataset used is not public, access to it and more information can be found here: [TristánC. A. (2021). Neural network Database [Conjunto de datos]. ]([https://www.google.com](http://hdl.handle.net/10259/5896))
