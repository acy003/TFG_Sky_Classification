abstract = {A full sky High Dynamic Range imaging system, based on a Single-Lens Reflex camera with a fisheye lens, has been constructed and calibrated with a sky scanner luminance meter. The method considers the geometrical, spectral, timing and orientation issues between instruments. The calibration data sets, having nearly simultaneous measurements under stable sky conditions, were obtained from approximately one month of data using selection variables based in the experimental design. For luminance estimation we use the standard CIEY RGB combination and a Spectrally Matched Luminance (SML) predictor, matching the spectral response of the instruments. With 738 calibration points having luminances up to 23.6kcd/m2, covering 98.5% of the sky luminance range, CIEY is linearly correlated with sky scanner measurements with a coefficient of determination R2=0.9927 and a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 7.7%. SML gives better results, with R2=0.9973 and RMSE=5.3%. With 253 calibration points with luminances up to 12.9kcd/m2, comprising 94.1% of the sky luminance range, both predictors clearly improve, with R2=0.9964 and RMSE=4.1% in case of CIEY and R2=0.9982 and RMSE=2.9% in case of SML.}

abstract = {Recently, the International Commission on Illumination (CIE) has adopted a range of 15 standard sky distributions representing the whole probable spectrum of actual skies in the world. Each sky standard has its own well-defined sky luminance pattern which can be conveniently used to calculate the sky radiance and luminance for a given sky patch and the solar irradiance and daylight illuminance on inclined surfaces facing various orientations. The crucial issues are whether the skies could be correctly identified. This paper presents the work on the classification of the CIE Standard General Skies using various climatic parameters and indices. Meteorological variables namely luminance distribution for the whole sky including zenith luminance, global, direct-beam and sky-diffuse illuminance on a horizontal surface and vertical sky illuminance, and horizontal and vertical solar irradiance data are adopted for analysis. The results demonstrate that there are a number of appropriate climatic parameters for sky classification and the selection depends on their availability, accuracy and sensitivity. The approaches could contribute to the estimation of solar irradiance and daylight illuminance which are essential to the renewable and sustainable developments and energy-efficient building designs.}

The International Commission on illumination (Commission International de l'Eclairage – CIE) has adopted a general sky model in 2003, which known now as the “ISO/CIE Standard General Skies”. Such model define the sky types into 15 types that range from cloudy to partly cloudy to clear sky. To classify a sky into one of these types, luminance data of the sky are needed. However, these data are not available in many countries. Therefore, and due to the fact that it is difficult to get accurate luminance measurements near the solar disk and due to the fact that the luminance of a single small patch of sky can fluctuate greatly, other methods that use sky illuminance have been proposed to help to fit a sky in one of the CIE 15 sky types. The goals of this paper is to test one of these methods against real luminance measurements.}

Sky conditions are frequently categorised into overcast, partly cloudy and clear using some common climatic data including cloud cover (CLD), sunshine hour (SH) and solar radiation. This paper presents the study of these climatic parameters and their applications in the classification of sky condition. Frequency of occurrence and cumulative frequency distribution of each sky indicator have been established to interpret the prevailing sky conditions in Hong Kong. Special features on defining the sky clearness are highlighted and the implications for energy-efficient building designs are discussed.}

abstract = {Since the publication of the standard sky luminance distributions (SSLD) that was consolidated in the ISO 15469:2004(E)/CIE S 011/E:2003, numerous procedures have emerged for the characterization of the sky condition according to that standard. Precisely, the use of different procedures for the classification of the skies of a certain place according to the ISO/CIE standard can lead to obtain different frequencies of sky types. The existing uncertainties in the characterization of the sky condition according to the CIE Standard General Sky as a consequence of the classification procedure used are analyzed in this study. For this, three different classification procedures are used to characterize the sky radiance and luminance distribution measurements made by means of a sky-scanner in Pamplona (Spain) from 2007 to 2013. That is, (1) a method focused on determining the relative gradation and indicatrix functions, (2) a method based on the comparison of measured and standard luminances normalized against the horizontal diffuse illuminance, and (3) a new high-spatial-resolution approach that compares measured and standard luminances relative to zenith. In general terms, it is concluded that there is some uncertainty in the classification depending on the procedure used to characterize the sky.}
