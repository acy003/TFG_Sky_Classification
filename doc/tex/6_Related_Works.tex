Having mentioned the previous work done on the topic of sky classification multiple times before, it is only natural to briefly summarize and reiterate its importance to this work.

\subsection{Pixel-Based Image Processing for CIE Standard Sky
Classification through ANN}
This work \cite{skyClassANN-Granados-Lop√©z}, focuses mainly on the application of image-processing techniques to improve the performance of ANNs (in this case foucsed on the accuracy) for sky classification under the CIE standard. It reviews 22 image-processing methods and applies them to the sky image dataset. It takes into account both the 15 CIE standard sky categories as well as a more generalized 3 category application. 

It also highlights that the usage of image-processing methods, depends on the target sky categories required, as the regular RGB channel, performed best when classifying for the simplified 3 category sky conditions of clear, partial and overcast.
