This repository contains the code used in my TFG project.

2 MATLAB scripts can be seen:

  1. tfgModel.m contains the script for training a artificial neural network. It can only be run with access to the dataset.
  2. predict.m contains the script for predicting classes on a specified dataset. It requires having the saved network in your MATLAB workspace/the script folder.
